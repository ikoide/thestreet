# The Street

![The Street vAlpha](thestreet_alpha.png)

I began this project on 25.01.2024 at work. Inspiration was of course from Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.

Would like to implement the following features:
- [ ] Ability for users to engage in 1-1 chats
- [ ] Connectivity over TOR for anonymity
- [ ] End-end encryption for privacy
- [ ] Integration with cryptocurrencies such as XMR for payments
- [ ] Ability for users to set up their own property on the street

Whole lot of work to do before that, it's only day one.
